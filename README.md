# chatappNode

Upon unzipping. You can run the node folder in your command promt using nodemon start. And run the chat app folder using npm start.

This app is actually a code along I did when I was watching a tutorial on making a chat app. This is not an original application I made.

But otherwise I do have projects I did from scratch.

Here are the links.

https://moneytracker-react.vercel.app/login

- this one is still a work in progress.

https://csp3-ecommerce-lina-react-app.vercel.app/

- this is an ecommerce web application required by the bootcamp I entered.
